* **Sound Synthesizer**\
_Java, JavaFX_\
Designed and implemented GUI to create different widgets for different types of sound waves with adjustable frequencies. Widgets are connected with cables, which link them on the back end and create different effects (sound mixing, volume adjustment, etc.) and allow them to be played out through the hardware.
